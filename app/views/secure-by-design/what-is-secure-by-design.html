                <p class="govuk-body">It is mandatory for government departments and arm's length bodies (ALBs).</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The aim of Secure by Design is to increase our cyber resilience and improve how we share data with other organisations. To do this we need to ensure cyber security is built into our systems and services from the start. The benefits of this are:</p>

                    <li>we'll be able to detect attacks earlier and respond more effectively, reducing the impact to the services we provide to the education sector</li>
