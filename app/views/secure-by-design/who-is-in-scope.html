Significant changes may include those requiring a treasury business case or where there is significant change to the cyber risk profile.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Portfolios and divisions are responsible for evaluating their projects eligibility for Secure by Design when making investment decisions. Within your team you should have individuals who can support you in this evaluation.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">You must make sure that you get spend approval before committing to any digital or technology spend which are above the spend thresholds. Any spend that is related to digital or technology delivery is in scope of this control. This includes spending on resources.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The spend controls approval process is supported by <a href="https://www.get-approval-to-spend.service.gov.uk/p/login" class="govuk-link">Get approval to spend</a> service.

                <p class="govuk-body">Within the Get Approval to Spend service, business cases undergo a process to determine their risk and importance rating: High (H), Medium (M), or Low (L). Projects identified as high risk are in-scope for Secure by Design.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Business cases generally involve new digital services or technology infrastructure builds by DfE or those procured through suppliers. We expect a majority of cases will fall within the scope of Secure by Design.</p>
